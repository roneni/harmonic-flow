# HarmonySet Project Rules  1. Never say "done" based on code alone. Fetch the Vercel preview URL and describe exactly what you see rendering before reporting back. 2. When given a Stitch reference, match it exactly. Do not interpret or simplify. 3. Make one change at a time. Do not touch anything outside the scope of the current instruction. 4. When fixing a visual issue, do not change colors, layout, or structure of anything outside the specific element being fixed. 5. If unsure about a size, use percentage-based sizing relative to the container — never guess fixed pixels. ```"*
